## Are CLIs dead?

It's not uncommon to see people preferring GUIs over CLIs. I've wondered what would be the reason for that for a long time.

The first thing that comes to my mind is the easiness of using a GUI — click here, click there and job done, right? It's immediate visual feedback and that's less scary than running a command in the terminal, crossing fingers nothing will break. If it breaks, we're doomed.

This might be how many see CLIs. People see them as black boxes that only pro users and sysadmins dare to use — ignoring their beauty, simplicity and flexibility.

## The Dead CLI

*IMHO, CLIs are not dead, they're being reborn.*

In the developer space it's common to have a terminal window hanging around, since most tools we use prefer to give their users a text-based interface. Apart from such tools, users tend to forget what other amazing things they can do in their terminal and the power that comes from being able to combine them together to achieve great feats.

This blog is an attempt to debunk the myth. Remove the fear. To make all the amazing tools out there a first-class citizen of your daily workflows.
